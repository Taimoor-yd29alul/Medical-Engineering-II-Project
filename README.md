# Medical Engineering II Project

## Project Overview

This project introduces fundamental image-processing techniques applicable across various fields. Designed for biomedical engineering students, it analyses cell images — a common image encountered in scientific research. Throughout the project, you’ll explore various image-processing techniques that are crucial for understanding and working with biological images.

## Techniques Involved

The project will guide you through the following core image-processing methods:

- **Basic Thresholding / Image Segmentation**
- **Segmentation Evaluation**
- **Otsu Segmentation**
- **Primitive Edge Detection**
- **Canny Edge Detection**

By the end of the project, you'll have developed a set of **ImageJ Plugins** that can perform all of these operations.

## Development Environment

The coding aspect of the project will be done in **Java**, using **IntelliJ IDEA** as the development environment.
